# GitHub Action - Mkdocs (and markdown) link check üîó‚úîÔ∏è

This GitHub action checks all Markdown files in your repository for broken links. It has been especially designed for mkdocs, but can also work for any markdown-based website. 

This action uses [byrnereese/linkchecker-mkdocs](https://github.com/byrnereese/linkchecker-mkdocs), and is heavily inspired by:

* [tcort/markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check)
* [gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check)

## How to use

1. Create a new file in your repository `.github/workflows/action.yml`.
1. Copy-paste the following workflow in your `action.yml` file:

   ```yml
   name: Check Markdown links
   
   on: push
   
   jobs:
     mkdocs-link-check:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@master
       - uses: byrnereese/github-action-mkdocs-link-check@v1.0
   ```

## Configuration

- [Custom variables](#custom-variables)
- [Scheduled runs](#scheduled-runs)
- [Disable check for some links](#disable-check-for-some-links)

### Custom variables

You customize the action by using the following variables:

| Variable  | Description   | Default value |
|:----------|:--------------|:--------------|
|`excludes` | One or more patterns to identify links that can be excluded or skipped in your tests. | *None* |
|`file-extension`|By default the `github-action-mkdocs-link-check` action checks files in your repository with the `.md` extension. Use this option to specify a different file extension such as `.markdown` or `.mdx`.|`.md`|
|`folder-path` |By default the `github-action-mkdocs-link-check` action checks for all markdown files in your repository, which typically are located in the `docs` directory for mkdocs projects. Use this option to limit checks to only specific folders. |`docs/` |
|`local-only` | Process local and relative links. No external or remote links will be tested. This speeds up processing considerably. | `false` |
|`method` | The HTTP method used for testing remote link validity. The GET method is more reliable, but much slower. | `get` |
|`recurse` |Recurse through the entire directory tree below the specified path.|`true` |
|`verbose-mode`|Specify `yes` to show detailed HTTP status for checked links. |`no` |

#### Sample workflow with variables

```yml
name: Check Markdown links

on: push

jobs:
  markdown-link-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: byrnereese/github-action-mkdocs-link-check@v1.0
      with:
        verbose-mode: 'yes'
        folder-path: 'docs/'
```

### Scheduled runs
In addition to checking links on every push, or pull requests, its also a good hygine to check for broken links regularly as well. See [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions - on.schedule](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule) for more details.

#### Sample workflow with scheduled job

```yml
name: Check Markdown links

on: 
  push:
    branches:
    - master
  schedule:
  # Run everyday at 9:00 AM (See https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07)
  - cron: "0 9 * * *"

jobs:
  markdown-link-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      with:
        verbose-mode: 'yes'
        folder-path: 'docs/'
```

### Check multiple directories and files

```yml

   ```
1. To use a major version of the action:
   ```yml

   ```
1. You can also specify a [specific commit SHA](https://github.com/byrnereese/github-action-mkdocs-link-check/commits/master) as an action version:
   ```yml
   - uses: byrnereese/github-action-mkdocs-link-check@44a942b2f7ed0dc101d556f281e906fb79f1f478
